# hello-world
This is my first repository. Idk wtf I'm doing!
I am a MPH student at UW studying Community Oriented Public Health. I hope to use coding skills to be able to manipulate data so that I can help communities make better health decisions and guide policy to be the most effective and beneficial it can be for those who need it most.
